        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am Arthad Kulkarni, a dedicated Computer Science student from Naples, Florida, with a lifelong interest in computer science. 
        Formerly a Student at Gulf Coast High School, I am currently enrolled at the University of Central Florida and have embarked on a journey to deepen my understanding and skills in this fascinating field.
        My experience with multiple programming languages has not only sharpened my technical abilities but also ignited a passion for software development. 
        Aspiring to become a software engineer, I am committed to mastering the intricacies of coding and software design.
        My journey is driven by a commitment to excellence and an eagerness to contribute to the constantly evolving technology landscape.

        My Experience
    </h2>
    <p>
        With a comprehensive background in multiple programming languages, including HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, C, and Python, I bring a rich blend of technical skills to the table. 
        My expertise extends into using frameworks like Django and React, which has been instrumental in my entrepreneurial journey of founding a social media marketing agency. 
        This venture not only honed my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS but also deepened my understanding of SEO, enabling me to leverage web technologies effectively for business growth. 
        Beyond my professional pursuits, I am actively involved in enriching my learning and networking within the tech community through participation in on-campus clubs. 
        Being a part of KnightHacks and the Google Student Developers Club allows me to stay at the forefront of technology trends, collaborate with like-minded peers, and contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.
